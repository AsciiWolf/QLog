QLog Notification
------------------

QLog can notify a third-party application(s) via UDP messages. 
Exchanged information include QSO operation (insert/update/delete), 
DX Cluster Spots, WSJTX Spots etc.

Message Format
--------------
The notification message is sent via UDP packets in JSON format.
A basic message structure is shown below

{
   "appid":"QLog",
   "msgtype":"QSO",
   "time":1647197319251,
   "data":{}
}

appid - string - an application ID of the sender.
                 In this case, it is always "QLog"

msgtype - string - the Message Type. 
                   Currently, the fields can take on the values:
                   "QSO"         - for contact (QSO) changes
                   "dxspot"      - for DX Spot
                   "wsjtxcqspot" - for WSJTX Spot

time - number - time when the message was sent from QLog.
                the field contains a number of milliseconds from 1.1.1970.

data - JSON Object - specific data depends on the Message Type. 
                     See chapter below for detailed description of 
                     the field structure.

QSO Notification
-----------------
msgtype : "QSO"
Description: QSO Notification message is sent in following cases:

   1) when a new QSO is inserted to the log
   2) when QSO is updated by the operator
   3) when QSO is deleted by the operator

"Data" Field Structure:

logid - string - UUID of the log database.
                 The Unique number for the log file
operation - string - QSO operation description. 
                     The following operations are emitted:
           "insert" - when a new QSO is inserted to the log
           "update" - when QSO is updated by the operator
           "delete" - when QSO is deleted by the operator
rowid - number - a unique ID of the record in the log file
type - string - the type of the "value" field. 
                Currently, only "adif" type is supported.
value - string - a contact record in the format defined by "type" format.
   if operation = "insert" then the field contains a new record
   if operation = "update" then the field contains an updated record. 
   if operation = "delete" then the field contains an old(deleted) record.
                If a contact record is updated and multiple contact fields are updated
                then QLog generates 1 Notification message to 1 updated contact 
                field. It means that if an operator updates 2 contact's 
                fields (or 1 field on which another field depends) 
                then 2 Notification messages are generated

Example of the QSO Notification Message:

{
   "appid":"QLog",
