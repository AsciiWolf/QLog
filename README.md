# QLog

QLog is an Amateur Radio logging application for Linux, Windows and Mac OS. It
is based on the Qt framework und uses SQLite as database backend.

QLogs aims to be as simple as possible, but to provide everything the operator expects from the log. This log is not currently focused on contests.

for Fedora:

`dnf install qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtwebengine-devel qt5-qtcharts-devel hamlib-devel qtkeychain-qt5-devel qt5-qtserialport-devel pkg-config`

for all:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/foldynl/QLog.git`

`cd  QLog`

for Debian:

`qmake QLog.pro`

for Fedora:

`/usr/bin/qmake-qt5`

for all:

`make`


### MacOS

**For developers:**

In order to build QLog on MacOS, following prerequisites must be satisfied.
1. [Xcode](#xcode) command line tools
2. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
3. [Qt](https://www.qt.io) with QtCreator

##### Xcode  
Xcode command line tools can be installed by issuing a command in command terminal:
```
xcode-select --install
```
**N.B.:** This command doesn't install Xcode itself, however It will take some time to download and  
install the tools anyway.

##### MacOS build
Last dependencies before building QLog are `hamlib` and `qtkeychain`:  
```
 brew install hamlib
 brew install --ignore-dependencies qtkeychain
```

As soon as the steps above are finished, QLog source can be opened in QtCreator, configured, built and run.  
QLog app (qlog.app) from the build artifacts folder can be later copied (`installed`) to `~/Applications` and  
accessed via Spotlight search bar.
