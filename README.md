# QLog

QLog is an Amateur Radio logging application for Linux, Windows and Mac OS. It
is based on the Qt framework und uses SQLite as database backend.

QLogs aims to be as simple as possible, but to provide everything the operator expects from the log. This log is not currently focused on contests.

### Linux

Prerequisites:

- Installed Trusted QSL (Optional) - `sudo apt install trustedqsl` or from [ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/tqsl-download)

**DEB packages** for currently supported Ubuntu versions are available for amd64, arm64 platforms via [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~foldyna/+archive/ubuntu/qlog). Ubuntu users can use following commands:

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:foldyna/qlog`

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install qlog`

Fedora **RPM packages** are available via GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/foldynl/QLog/releases/latest)

**Snap or Flatpak** are not planned at this moment.


### MacOS

 **DMG package** is available via GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/foldynl/QLog/releases/latest)

### Windows

Prerequisites:

- Installed [Trusted QSL](http://www.arrl.org/tqsl-download) (Optional)

Installation package is available via GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/foldynl/QLog/releases) .



## Compilation

### General

Prerequisites

- Installed Qt
- Installed [qtkeychain-devel](https://github.com/frankosterfeld/qtkeychain) library and headers
- Installed [OpenSSL-devel](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries) libraries and headers
- Installed [HamLib-devel](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/releases/latest) libraries and headers

`qmake` supports listed input parameters that affect the compilation process.

- `HAMLIBINCLUDEPATH` - the path to Hamlib Includes 
- `HAMLIBLIBPATH` - the path to Hamlib Library 
- `HAMLIBVERSION_MAJOR` - Hamlib version - major number (must be present if `pkg-config` cannot determine Hamlib version)
- `HAMLIBVERSION_MINOR` - Hamlib version - minor number (must be present if `pkg-config` cannot determine Hamlib version)
- `HAMLIBVERSION_PATCH` - Hamlib version - patch number (must be present if `pkg-config` cannot determine Hamlib version)
- `QTKEYCHAININCLUDEPATH` - the path to QtKeyChain Includes 
- `QTKEYCHAINLIBPATH`- the path to QtKeyChain Library

Leave variables empty if system libraries and Hamlib version autodetect (calling `pkg-config`) should be used during compilation (for Windows, the parameter must be present)

An example of use:

`
C:/Qt/6.4.1/msvc2019_64/bin/qmake.exe C:\Users\devel\development\QLog\QLog.pro -spec win32-msvc "CONFIG+=qtquickcompiler" "HAMLIBINCLUDEPATH = C:\Users\devel\development\hamlib\include" "HAMLIBLIBPATH =  C:\Users\devel\development\hamlib\lib\gcc" "HAMLIBVERSION_MAJOR = 4" "HAMLIBVERSION_MINOR = 5" "HAMLIBVERSION_PATCH = 0" "QTKEYCHAININCLUDEPATH = C:\Users\devel\development\qtkeychain_build\include" "QTKEYCHAINLIBPATH = C:\Users\devel\development\qtkeychain_build\lib" && C:/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/jom/jom.exe qmake_all
`

### Windows

Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2019

To be honest, It is not easy to compile it under Windows but it is possible.

### Linux

for Debian:

`sudo apt-get -y install qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools libsqlite3-dev libhamlib++-dev libqt5charts5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqt5keychain1 qt5keychain-dev qtwebengine5-dev build-essential libqt5serialport5-dev pkg-config`

for Debian (QT6):

`sudo apt-get -y install libhamlib-dev build-essential pkg-config qt6-base-dev qtkeychain-qt6-dev qt6-webengine-dev libqt6charts6-dev libqt6serialport6-dev libqt6webenginecore6-bin libqt6svg6-dev libgl-dev`

for Fedora:

`dnf install qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtwebengine-devel qt5-qtcharts-devel hamlib-devel qtkeychain-qt5-devel qt5-qtserialport-devel pkg-config`

for both:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/foldynl/QLog.git`

`cd  QLog`

for Debian:

`qmake QLog.pro`

for Debian (QT6):

`qmake6 QLog.pro`

for Fedora:

`/usr/bin/qmake-qt5`

NOTE: if it is necessary then use `qmake` input parameters described above to affect compilation. The input parameter must be use in case when Hamlib or qtkeychain are compiled from their source code repos.

for all:

`make`

### MacOS

In order to build QLog on MacOS, following prerequisites must be satisfied.

1. [Xcode](#xcode) command line tools
2. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
3. [Qt](https://www.qt.io) with QtCreator

##### Xcode  

Xcode command line tools can be installed by issuing a command in command terminal:

```
xcode-select --install
```

**N.B.:** This command doesn't install Xcode itself, however It will take some time to download and  
install the tools anyway.

##### MacOS build

Last dependencies before building QLog are:

```
 brew install qt6
 brew link qt6 --force
 brew install hamlib
 brew link hamlib --force
 brew install qtkeychain
 brew install dbus-glib
 brew install brotli
 brew install icu4c
```

As soon as the steps above are finished, QLog source can be opened in QtCreator, configured, built and run.  
QLog app (qlog.app) from the build artifacts folder can be later copied (`installed`) to `~/Applications` and  
accessed via Spotlight search bar.

NOTE: if it is necessary then use `qmake` input parameters described above to affect compilation. The input parameter must be use in case when hamlib or qtkeychain is compiled from their source code repos.
